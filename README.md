# XSLT, XPATH, and XQuery examples

### Description
A little project to learn XSLT, XPATH, and Query. These are just some examples I worked through while learning XSLT, XPATH, and XQuery. 

For XQuery, the SAXON (Query ~ saxon9he.jar) library was used. 

The App.java does not do anything. The .xsl are run as, and the xquery stuff is run using saxon.query as a java application configuration with a program argument as *.xq or *.xqy files.
